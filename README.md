# PointsApp

PointsApp is a SwiftUI-based watchOS app for tracking scores in various sports matches. This application allows you to quickly select a sport, set up a match type (1 vs 1 or 2 vs 2), optionally define a custom scoring system, and start keeping track of points and sets right from your wrist. The app also provides a match history feature, enabling you to review past matches and recall previous scores. Additionally, you can customize which sports appear in your main menu through the Settings feature.

## Features

- **Sport Selection:** Choose from multiple sports like Tennis, Badminton, Ping Pong, Squash, Padel, Football, or define a Custom sport.
- **Match Setup:** Decide the scoring type (Set vs No Set), points per set (if applicable), and select player or team avatars.
- **Real-time Scoring:** Increment scores for each side, see scores update live, and track sets and points as you play.
- **Match History:** Review up to 25 of your most recent matches, complete with date, sport, and final scores.
- **Customization:** Use the built-in Settings to reorder and toggle the visibility of sports in your main menu, tailoring the app to your preferences.
